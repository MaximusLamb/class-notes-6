# Object Literals
## In an object variables become known as **properties**.
## In an object functions become known as **methods**.
## Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and a value.  In an object that name is called a **key**.
* Objects cannot have two keys with the same name.  Because the keys are used to access their corresponding values.
##  The value of a property can be a **string**, **number**, **Boolean**, **array**, or even another object.  The value of a method is always a **function**.
# The DOM
## As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.  The model is called the **DOM** tree, and it is stored in the browsers memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.
### Document nodes
### Element nodes
### Attribute nodes
### Text nodes
## Steps to working with the DOM tree
### 1. Access the elements
### 2. Work with those elements
## Accessing the elements
* getElementById()
* querySelector()
* getELementByClassName()
